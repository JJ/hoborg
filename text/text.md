Meet the mechanical man
----------------------------------

There he was, gleaming in places, rusty in others. Rolling and
whistling and frolicking to the general merriment of the public. 
And I'm using *he* liberally here, since I'm talking about a
mechanical man. A mechanical being. A mechanical... gimmick that looks
like a man.

I didn't really liked it, but I had no other way out than be attached to it. And the public... filled with brothers, of my own race, of the other
races that have been oppressed since they arrived here or since the
paleface newcomers arrived. Even palefaces, because all races are one and the same in the People's 
Republic, ain't that? 

But I am not a paleface, because my name is Fulgencio
Rivera and  I was born and raised in California from a Guatemalan mother and
a Mexican father. That was twenty and three years ago. 

Now I'm here, at the Circus for the People, amusing myself while I bid
my time to get hold of the mechanical man, which is the main reason
I am here. Here being Freedomville, formerly called Jacksonville, as
in Andrew Jackson, a paleface and slaver long dead and now definitely
buried. 

And now being the tenth year after the revolution that produced the United
All Races People's Republic of Florida, or, if you prefer, la República Unida de Todas las Razas de Florida. 

But a free man has to earn a living, or a better living than the Republic is able to provide. That is why I am after Manuel,
the mechanical man. A real marvel of the People's Republic
ingenuity. Just look at him. All by himself, he has hushed everyone in
this dusty, hot, humid and forsaken place. How can I describe it? I
lack words, because there is nothing like it in the whole wide
world. I can try, even as I received only the barest education before
the capitalist system started to exploit my juvenile skills back there
in awful California of evil America.

But I am jumping over myself. Let me tell you how it all started.

Who wants a mechanical man?
-------------------------------------------

*revise* 

So this is what you hobos do, right? Sit around the fire in this rail
yard... Jungle? How come you call this a jungle? It's a railway
switchyard! OK, jungle. And you tell stories, right? And you want to
hear mine? OK, Duke, I owe you. So here it goes. 

This story starts in Mobile, a rough and tumble border town of the
United All Races People's Republic of Florida. That's a pretty long
name for a place that starts at Pascagoula and and goes no further
than Brunswick, if only our people  have their way. Which they
will, I have no doubt as a loyal citizen of the Republic. Every dawning day brings new brothers to our
new republic, brothers of all races, creeds and dispositions. 

It was early winter and it was still sunny and mild. The air was clear, and I could see ships docking and leaving, 
ships from all sister nations of the world, Spain, Cuba, Colombia, but also not-so-friendly places 
who decided the buck needn't stop here and had resumed trade as soon as they could, 
the United Kingdom, the Austrohungarian Empire, those bohunks... I was there, taking a walk in the docks, minding my own business,
which was precisely what I was looking for at that early moment of the day. I was
looking for a hire, for somebody who needed a quick mind and a strong pair
of arms, and dodging the sun and keeping myself in the shade,
because the sun made  my clothes too warm for comfort. What was it? January? December? Can't
tell. Even less so now that all months have changed their names to
something that does not have gods or umpirators or unpopular names.
That means that people no longer know the month they are
in. Not that most of them had ever cared, anyways. And not that I have a
grudge with that, either. It's all for the greater good of the
Republic, ain't it? Keeping capitalists names out of the Republic. 

So, it was mild going on warm and these two dandy types came up to me from the sea
shore, maybe from a ship, dressed to the
nines and sweating as if they were going to melt right there. Sticking out as a
sore thumb, if you ask me, no way to walk in the docks crying "Mug
me"; adding insult to injury they were also  yelling "I'm a capitalist
pig". But I was minding my own business, which was not related to those
guys, which were nondescript besides what I have already said. They
probably had not been mugged yet because one of the dandies had his
demeanor bolted on, instead of having been born into it. Strong but
nondescript too. Or nondescript for a those-fists-mean-business
meaning of the word. 

Was not afraid, though, although they also seemed to avoid the sun and had
their caps set just so you could not really see their face. So
that you could not describe it later. That is why they were
nondescript. Hey, said that already. You weren't listening?

The non-strong non-descript guy seemed to be the one that was going to
do the talking. After exchanging pleasantries, which is the right
thing to do for well-educated gentlemen that we all were, they offered
me a cigar which I rejected because I don't smoke, as you might have
already noticed, and went down to business, not-strong in front of me
and fists-mean-business by my side and slightly behind me. He really
meant business that way too.

No, Gummy, I didn't hit them. Why should I? I was down on my luck, and
one's got to earn a living. 

And a good living it might be, too. Ten thousand pesos on the spot,
ten thousand more when I got them something, which they really, really
wanted for no particular reason. They collected. They had a hardware
store. They liked shiny, rolling things. They wanted the Man, they
wanted something called Manuel the Mechanical Man. Which was, metaphorically speaking,
I know, Duke, you like when I speak metaphorically, kicking dust in a
circus.  What was my business before that, do you want to know? Dock hand, I
just told you, Gummy. Damn, do you want to hear the story or not?

I had never heard of the thing. You have? Well, I hadn't, I was not so
well informed and educated as you all apparently are in this
jungle. So the speaking non-descript man described the thing for me,
just in case I got it wrong and got them a kicking watering can or a
singing flower pot.  

"This gimmick Manuel you've got to get us  is like a a rolling
teakettle with ears", he told me.  

A rolling teakettle with ears
------------------------------------

Think about a teakettle. You got it? That's it, thicker on the bottom
and not so much on top. Yes, Count, we all know you served tea to
royalty in your castle in Central Europe. Alright, south by southwest
Europe. Whatever. You picture that, right? That would be a milk pail
for you, Gummy. Please stop smiling or I'll never ever say your name
aloud again. You all got the milk pail? Well, now put it on top of the
teakettle. A small one. Two milk pails for you, Gummy. Lost you? Aw,
what the hell, just go to sleep again. 

Lost you all? Big, roundish, thick-on-the-bottom, metallic, upside-down
bucket with another on top, body and head. Which goes to account for
the name mechanical man, but when I first saw him that what I though
about. It was even steaming a little bit, because he's not actually
mechanical, you see, it's also fuel-powered ad some electrickal cables
to spark it to motion whenever it's needed. Or something like that. I
didn't built it, I just carry it from one place to another. 

And, you see, it ain't have any legs. I don't know why, man, but those
four wheels it has on the bottom just save me a lot of work. Yes, it
did have some sort of midget legs at the beginning, but they made him,
er, it, a piece of larry on stilted legs so they were ripped of and
substituted by this bogie rigged from, gee, I really don't know. A toy
train? A streetcar? But the wheels, they had real tires on them, lest
it could move only on rails. Come to think of it, I'll have to patch
them, they seem the worse for wear now... 

Of course the legs didn't go to waste! They were used for a sideshow
in the ten-in-one called Robbie Lee, the Half-Mechanical Wonder of the
New Century!

So what we have here is a teakettle with ears on wheels. A mechanical
hobo. A hobo mechanical organism? Count, I like that. Cut it down to
hoborg and you've got it! Pass the bottle, man, don't hog it all for yourself!

Arms? Gee, I forgot that. Of course it did have arms! Just two of
them, yes. I always wondered why. Come to build a thing with arms, you
could make it with three or four or what have you. But no, it had to be two and
they looked like those in mannequins, with a joint in the elbow and
another at the shoulder and a grip at the end. No hands, just a
grip. I didn't try to wrestle with him, no way. It was four hundred
pounds of iron and copper. The grips were made with copper, and they
could be so delicate as to grasp a pigeon egg without breaking
it. Great machine, I tell you. 

Yes, let's make it dance for a while, let me just get my driving box. 
Eyes. Did I say anything about the whole fucking *face*? No proper
face to speak of, really, but as soon as there's something on top of
the body, not that it's a proper body either, but you get my
drift... so if that's a *head* the grilled gap on the bottom, that
would be a mouth, right? On top of that a strut could be the nose, and
two holes covered with glass the eyes. Some dummy painted two lines on
top of that that could go for eyebrows, and then two holes on the side
of the head with two half-moons behind them. It could move left and
right, that's it. It made a screeching noise, like a door closing. A
teensy door closing. 

When it walked, or rather rolled, there was smoke coming out of its
neck. Some dummy put it initially in the ass, but it made the eyes of
whoever was driving it sting, so somebody else rigged it to have the
exhaust as hight as possible. Not in the head, it wouldn't look
healthy, people would keep saying "Your dummy is *burning*!".

Anyway, the noise. It could honk, did I tell ya? Yes, he can do stuff
all of its own when he wants. When there's something in front, I don't
know how the hell it does that, but he notices and honks the same way
that he avoids to crash into people by just stopping. How do I know
how it does that? Am I a fucking mechanician? So, all things
considered,  it sounded like a car coming at you if you didn't see it
coming. A honking, screeching, clanking little car.

And now, for all of you, a honking, screeching, clanking dancing
mech, that's what they told me. Well, not all of that, I added a little bit on my own. Tomorrow, or the day after that, I'll tell you how I became a 
circus roustabout.

Here's a bit of money to get you started
----------------------------------------------------

And a printout of where this marvel could be found, since, to top all
that, he didn't stay in a single place, but kept moving all over the
place with a circus.  

"A circus?" I asked. "What does it do? Bite chicken heads off?"

"As far as we know, it could bite the head of something considerably
bigger than a chicken." He said, while Fist-means-business smiled in a
nondescript way. "But yes, we can say it does that too".  

I got the money, I told them I took it from there, and they were on
their way and I
never ever saw them again, and I won't until I do the delivery in a
few days. Now that I've got what they want I'll have
to look for them when I arrive at my destination. Or rather they will
look for me. 

Whatever, that's not going
to be today. No, today I'm not gonna tell you about my joining the
circus either.  Something I didn't really thought was going to be
necessary. 

Duke of Poo tell his story
--------------------------------

Ladies and gentlemen, our dear Fulgencio seems to be a bit under the
weather today or just plainly fed up with telling stories, so it's
going to be my pleasure to delight you today with the story of my
life before the Call. No, Gummy Eddy, you've never heard this before, I
promise. It's all made up, I mean, this is the real deal, all I've
told you before was made up. Besides, I haven't
even started to drink today! Oh my, I haven't even started to drink
today. Somebody buy me a drink, oh please. Captain Cabo? 

That's better. So, it's my pleasure now to tell you the story. When I was a little boy... 

OK, OK, please behave yourselves. I
will cut it short. During the  War I was in the Glorious
Confederate Army, so yes, what's with it? This was Florida, it was a
confederate state, I was conscripted! I never had any slaves! I've
told you! 

Thanks, Captain, we *former* soldiers have to respect and care for
each other. I'll go ahead with it. So I when I left my ducal in
Georgia, all smartly dressed in gray to which I added a foulard which
really suited the rest, I went to the railway station and instead of
being shipped somewhere else in the train I was assigned on the spot
to a crew of railway artillery. I was back and forth, never leaving
the iron path for as long as there was a war, so I learned the trade
from one tip of the train to another: where to consign, who sells
coal, how much is a load of cotton worth. 

I was several times on the brink of being seized by the damn yankees,
I mean the gringos, but the end of the war found me on a southbound
train. Somehow, I made the new authorities believe it was mine and
that I was a loyal yankee citizen. They even paid for repairs, once
all was over. 

That was my first train. I still have it, you can see on the lawn of
the castle I own in the Big Rock Candy Mountain, near the Lemonade
springs. But all that is lost to me. When Florida was no longer a
state of the Union all was taken from me, all the train lines I had
painstakingly gathered were, overnight, property of the people of
Florida.  I lost fuck-all.  It was stolen by these damn fanatics!

Down and out and with ten thousand pesos in Mobile and Panama City.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In the name of the people, Duke, just stop crying like a
sissy. Somebody buy him more drink or take him to sleep or
both. Besides, you all wanted to listen to my story, right? Here it
goes...

The circus seemed to be not too far, somewhere in West Florida. There
I went. This was going to be easy as peaches. Go there, get in, grab
it, get out. Except it was not.  

With the ten thou I had when I arrived at Panama City, where the circus
happened to be a few days later, I couldn't even have bought a ride
with the circus. Which, come to think of it, was what the two guys
would have done to start with if it had been even possible.  They wouldn't have needed anyone to do it for them. Or maybe they did, so I had to check anyways.  

Not that it was. Not that I had the ten thousand any more, a man has
got expenses and love is not always free, as you may know. Yes, young
men like me don't have it that difficult but I was in a hurry and that
hoochie koochie girl looked like she could give me information, and
boy, did she give me all she could... and I gave her a few pesos. A
few dozens. 

But I had good information. It was late winter in Panama City, and it
was one of the first cities in their 1915 tour. All tents were shiny,
all guys seemed jolly and all girls beautiful and caring. I came in
through the gate, yes, the arch, but I didn't know that back then, and
there was the carnival in full swing, tents forming an U with the
circus, menagerie at the very end. It was a bit windy and kind of
chilly, so people didn't loiter among the tents, speeding from one to
the next to end at the skin show or one of the gambling tents if it was a
man or a couple of friends or at the circus if it was a whole family. 

I would have done the man route, but I needed to get acquainted with
the layout and the possibilities. Stealing something is not too
difficult, but the problem is that always you have to invest. That's
quite American, I know, and I'm a well-behaved Floridian citizen, but
I tell you that happens here and there and everywhere.

The problem is to know how much to invest and where to do
it. Sometimes it's just a ladder. Others you might need to get strong
and arm yourself. At best, you might need a smile and a certain among
of time with a good-smelling but bad-looking girl, or maybe the other
way round. And sometimes you just need to pay the right man. 

But where was the right man? Who was the mechanical man tamer or
whatever you called him? And how much was it worth?

Because it seemed quite obvious that ladder or weapons were going to take
me nowhere. Too many people, too many fences, and I expected the mech
to be heavy enough to not be able to lift it. I was wrong by two or
three men, but I didn't know that back them, so I just thought about
cows and how rustlers would have done it. Not that rustlers even had
to do it inside a carnival, but this mech didn't have horns either, so
I guess it was even, right? Stop mooing, Gummy, it's not funny and I
was really tied in knots there. Short of hiring a small army and a
truck, for which I was a good few thousands shorts, I just couldn't
see the way.

But that didn't stop me from wandering around looking for the mech,
the watchers, the way to get to that and eventually walk away with the
prize. I visited the menagerie, where the mechanical man was exhibited
and actually saw it in the flesh, yes, Duke, in the metal and brass or
whatever, point taken, for the first time.

It was given a privileged position within the menagerie tent, right at
the end of it, where the two rows met. It got the most light, with a
spotlight right below it that made it look like, well, like a statue,
which it was in way, except for the moving thing. I was not awed; I
actually liked the most the cute and fearsome Siamese twins that were
right beside him.

What did it do? Well, it was in a cage and the barker spent most of
the time in front of him saying that it had been studied in the
biggest and baddest (his very words) of the world and found to be a
real marvel, that it had acted in front of the bohunk emperor and the
king of Siam, and that the popists where studying if it had soul or
not. While the barker talked, the mech rocked back and forth,
sometimes striking the jail bars and making everybody step back with
cries of surprise and fear. Nice show it was, really. The Siamese
twins were actually kind of pissed and from time to time threw snots
or worse at him, making the bearded woman and the rest of the sideshows laugh and mock
them. 

I stayed there for three or four pitches, checking visually the bolts
on the cage, looking how far it was from the door, whether there were
any roustabouts lounging around with nothing better to do that
watching it, and so on. And I was paying attention to no one, so that
explains what happened next, when I got out, intending to walk around
the tent and waiting for the sideshow to close to see where everything
went. 

Hey, are you interested in the mechanical man?
--------------------------------------------------------------

"I sure am" I answered the besuited man that was calling me from
behind a carriage corner.   You'd be well advised if you walk off calls
made from behind a carriage corner. Hell, you've probably called marks
from behind carriage corners a few times anyways. Yes, you laugh, but
look at it from the point of view of the lugen. Hey, stop laughing!
Lugens do have a point of view! OK, OK, they probably haven't or they
wouldn't be so incredibly dumb.

So I was dumb, and I know now, but I didn't know them. The whole
circus mission, I mean gig, got into me and it seemed kind of so out
of the way that I just jumped to the opportunity.

"You like that, metal, right? Are you sure you don't want warm, expert
ladies that are able to do what no doll would ever do?" By that time,
I had already had a taste of that, so I just smiled and said "Just the
mech. Can I see it?"

"You can do more than that. You can take it for a ride if you want,
take it home and paint it pink." He had probably seen my enthusiasm
and raised his offer. What the hell, he could have offered me the
whole fucking circus. "How much is that worth for you?"

"American dollars?" I replied, and the suited man snorted. Now I could see that the
suit had been recently cleaned, ironed and starched, but was the worse
for wear and frayed in places. And his hair was not greased back,
just dirty and greasy. He was a lot louse, probably, somebody
wandering around circus lots looking for somebody that can be easily
conned.

Enough with that. I know better now. But maybe you can learn from me,
yes, a young man like me. Stop laughing! Stop rolling on the floor! Aw,
go to hell. 

The day they took the railway from me
---------------------------------------------------

I'm alright now. Liquor and spirits soothe my soul, because I have a
soul and I don't give a rat's ass if you  are going
to run to the next comisaría and denounce me for anti-popular
activities. What could they take from me? My freedom? My life? They
can have it all and good riddance, I've always lived next to a rail
yard and, before I'm caught, I'll die in them.

As a point of fact, I was about to do exactly that the day they took
my railway from me. The name of Jacksonville had just been changed to
Freedomville and I had a ungodly amount of schedules and train plates
and tickets to reprint, the exact amount I had to retire and pulp lest
it went to waste. I really didn't listen to the wireless when they
talked about factories and plantations and everything becoming
people's property; I didn't know what they meant either. People's
property? I was the people, and that was my property, right? So
nothing to fear although I noticed that day the employees were either
lazy or jittery or both. When was that? Nineteen o seven? Eight? Hell,
eight, ten years ago. Besides, I though, that was for Tampa for the
show, they were not going to go so far as Baldwin, where our offices
were conveniently located, close to the railroad junction.

But they did, for the life of me, they did. It was quite early in the
morning, what, seven or eight, I had been already there for two or
more hours, missus and kids still sleeping with all likelihood. An
injun entered my office without knocking, followed by Ralph, the
general manager of the airline and then so many Guards that you could
think they were going to stage a parade just there. But if that was
the case, I didn't want to know what role I was going to play in
it. Either the parade clown or part of the chain gang.

Initially, they were quite civil about the whole affair. A
bespectacled man elbowed his way to the front row and stood by the
Injun commander, who just stood there without so much as a good
morning. 

"Mr Miles Higgins", yes, my name is Miles, I got the railroad from the
baptismal pile, you know, "by this bylaw the People's Government of
Florida becomes the sole proprietor of the West Florida Railroad and
Wagon Company, formerly owned by one such Mr. Miles Higgins". I stood
up, but the Indian gestured to make me sit down. "Comrade Higgins will
be appropriately compensated by being allowed to work in the
Conglomerate of State Railroads in any posts he thereby chooses,
constrained by his stated abilities and the appraisal of them
performed by the Republic Workers Bureau". So they were taking the
whole thing from me and I'll be allowed to be a conductor if I was
considered smart enough to make holes in tickets. 

I tried to stand up again, but this time the commander did not even
bother to assuage the situation. He drew his revolver and pointed in
my general direction.

"You can stay here for some time. People's Comisario García here," and
he nodded in the direction of the bureaucrat that had just talked,
"will take charge and you'll have to show him the ropes. No hurry,
man, two or three days will be enough."

What could I do? My wife and family left me the next day, and they
took everything that could be loaded into a carriage. The authorities
didn't like that and seized my home and land, too. I was left
homeless, so when I left the office the last day and assigned a depot
in the middle of nowhere, I took a train and called it home. And you
are my family. 

Buying elephants from a circus
----------------------------------------

I have never been in the army. Did I say I was a soldier? No way, Captain,
I would have said that if I *had* been in the army, which I
wasn't. The point is, in the army the mates, or so I've heard, try to
con you into cleaning their boots, out of your food sent from home,
whatever. So you learn the looks of somebody who is turning a
confidence trick on you.

I learned the lesson  there and then. He had a look of contempt towards me, but
at the same time he looked desperate. As if that was in dire need of
something. But then, who was I to say anything, I looked as if I
needed a mechanical man then and there. 

He led me into a dark part of the circus, behind the carriages and we
started to dodge chairs, rests of food and forgotten toys. We arrived
at a carriage which didn't stand in any way from the rest; it was
freshly painted but didn't have any mark that indicated that was it,
the mech carriage. He purposefully knocked on the door, looking at me
and moving his mouth in the first phase of a smile that tried to
instill trust but would have failed if it weren't for the fact that I
was beyond worrying about trust, My mind could only focus on what was
inside that
carriage. And he saw that.

"So, how many pesos, real money,  is this worth for you?" he asked me. 

I didn't answer straight away. But that was probably the wrong answer,
because he knew that, come this point, I wasn't gonna get back. 

"Hell, man, I don't know. I'll have to get me some ride or something
to carry it away, and that's gonna cost me... So, listen, say I give
you one hundred pesos..." He was looking away, and drawing his hand
from the door. "Can't go further than two hundred". 

"Show me the money." he said, gesturing with his right hand. Luckily,
I just had a wad of notes in the front pockets of my pants, which is what you want
to do if you don't want to have it spirited away from you. Save it to have
conned it away from you, as I was about to.  I gave it to him and he
made the money disappear in a rustle of its clothes. 

He told me to follow him. Nobody answered the knock from inside, so we
entered anyways. It was dark inside, and 
we could barely see anything from the light that entered from the
already dark outside. He lighted a match.

"You see? It's right here." He said, but I barely could see where he was pointing. We kept bumping into things. 

"I can't see a damn thing, man. Can't you turn on the light?"

"Afraid not, it could damage the mechanical man, my friend has said"

"Damage it? How come? It performs in broad daylight"

"Yes, but it's being repaired right now due to a light... surplus. You
see? It's right here" 

What I could see there was, indeed, a teakettle. Not a whole
teakettle, just a part. I couldn't even see if it had ears or not. 

"That's a teakettle".

"No, it's not. It's a head... apparatus. See, here's the... belly
engine." Which looked like a stovepipe, or part of it that was visible
by the match that he has lighted, anyways. 

"You're full of shit, man." I told him. "I'm out of here."

I opened the door. There was another guy loitering at the entrance. He
dropped the cigarette and blocked the end of the stairs that descended
from the carriage, arms loose at the sides of the body, hands into
fists. Ready to mug me out of whatever I had left in my pockets. But I
was not going to make it easy: I jumped from the carriage door on him
and made him fall. I fell too, but stood up pretty quickly and started
running. They were older than me, and anyway I didn't think they would
make much more than shouting abuse at me for a while.

I was out the circus pretty fast. Same speed I was left without a
plan. 

It's a plan
-------------

"So you're saying the circus is like an office?" I told the old clown
who had the strange ability of laughing and crying at the same time,
and make you do the same. 

"Man, the whole country is like a fucking factory? Haven't you
noticed?" He cried again. We were in a cargo wagon, surrounded by
cotton bales on a train bound for Pascagoula, where I was following
the circus, thinking that it was better to follow it and wait for the
mech to drop from a carriage or be sold in an auction or
something. Hoboing was a way of doing that and not make a dent on my
budget. The clown had been a jolly companion until I asked him what
made a tramp clown become a tramp. 

"And all that because you made fun of the governor?" 

"Yes, and I think I could because he was white, you see? All races and
all my ass".

"What did you say?"

"Something along the lines of him being circumcised by a precise
kick to her sister in the jaw". 

"He, that is funny. I met these guys up in the hills in New Mexico, I
mean Mississippi, that... " It was funny that I had found this
particular guy in the train, but chance didn't play a role in it. He
was also following the circus, which was a few wagons in front of us,
bumming things out of them or of the people attending the carnival,
making laughs for centavos. 

"It's funny because that what clowns do. They make fun of people. It's
not about making fun of the right people, that takes all the fun out
of it. Like making a circus a factory."

"Come again, how's that?" I needn't tell you that the cotton cargo
wagon is the most comfortable of all. To top it, it's also quiet. Only
problem is you can't smoke or you'll become a ball of cotton fire in
no time. Ain't that true, Eyebrowless Eric?

"Well, it's not called the People's circus for no reason." he
said. "It belongs to the state, as this railway does. So the very next
day this mean person, dressed in combat clothes, came up to me and he
said.

"Teach me everything, from now on I'll be you. 

"That he said. I don't know what
the rest of the clown posse said, but they're not there anymore. And
they look mean..." But I was only half-listening by now. I had a plan.

*revise* 

I married a bearded woman
------------------------------------

Not quite, although seducing one of them would be a way of marrying
into the circus, I was not amused by that prospect. So I have two words
for you: Fake. Papers. 
With them in hand, I crossed under the circus arch, which had just arrived
to the city of Ferry Pass. 

"Let me check that." said the improbably named Boris, the circus
manager, a big, dark brother with shoulders one mile long that could
have stood for the strongman or the lion tamer if there was a need for
that. The papers with purple official-looking seals carried me into  the carriage that served as office and as 
ticket booth, these circus guys like to keep all money matters close
together, lest they contaminate the rest of the stuff. I had made a beeline from the
circus arch, which I didn't know yet was called an arch, to the
office. The less people that could intercept you and ask questions
about your business, the better. Circus people aren't known for
cheerful treatments of strangers. 

Besides Boris, that had been fetched from his office, a man and a
woman were idling at their desks, rustling papers and listening to the
wireless, which was broadcasting a speech by one of the high-ups in
our Republic. I tried to listen intently, but couldn't make out the words. He didn't seem
angry, so he was probably cheering up the soldiers, workers and farmers of our
land. I probably had heard them anyways. 

I saw Boris, my not so evidently fake papers in hands, go to its office at one of the ends of the carriage. I
knew the assignment would check out. The official at the People's Party in 
Pascagoula had been paid dearly to request an assignment of one
Fulgencio Ribera, 23, to the Number One Glorious People's Flying Circus, Menagerie, and
Moral Popular Exhibition Featuring Karl the Elephant and the Mysterious
Mechanical Man. Took less for him to take the bribe than to write the
name of the job where I wanted to be transferred. Took him a bit
more to endow the paper with all kinds of stamps and produce a good amount of copies and leave a huge
paper trail all the way to Tampa.  
A second bribe
would be needed for the archivist, but that was all. Yes, capitalista
ways in the people's republic and all that. I didn't like it as a citizen, but I
like even less the umpirialist ways of the United-not-for-long
States. Did I say umpirialist? I meant umpirialistic. Imperialist? You
made that word up, Duke, didn't you? OK, OK, OK, imperialist, so what
gives? 

When Boris was gone and apparently using the phone in his office, I started to think that what's bad about crooked officials is that they can bend two or three
different ways. And this Boris was having too long a conversation with Tampa  or whoever the hell he had decided to talk. It was not helping that the clerk and the secretary kept
looking at me with that look of "You don't belong here" which I tried
hard not to return. And this was starting to look like a situation in
which I would have to fight my way out, so I edged a bit closer to the door because you never know.

To avoid their gaze I started to look around. In the walls of the office hanged posters of announcements and
features. "Manuel The Mighty Mechanical Man" featured what looked like a guy
sheathed in gold foil lifting an elephant. "Ray, the Human Radio Receiver"
was on another poster, dressed like a sailor for no good reason and with a
hat from which several wires sprouted; from those wires, wavy lines came
out (or in, who knows) while he seemed to be speaking, arms wide
open. I'd heard about that one, and it looked like a scam. But then I
was not buying this circus, I was here for a reason. A heavy, metallic,
mechanical reason.

I realized Boris had stopped talking and shortly he came back from his office at the end of the
carriage. And he did not seem happy. 

School years
------------------

No, that's Fulgencio Ribera, with a b. I don't know any Rivera from
anywhere. I went to school in... What's with it? Why do you want to
know? Did I ask you where you served, Captain? Does anybody know the
whereabouts of Duke's castle? Yes, yay, in the slopes of the Big Rock
Candy Mountain by the Lemonade Springs. 

Just go to hell. I'm off to sleep. 

You don't look like a circus person
---------------------------------------------

"Sorry, boy. This does not check out." He said, handing the papers
back to me. The clerks nodded and continued their rustling and radio
listening. From another poster, Mento the Mystical Miner, eyes wide
open, was looking at me trying to find out what I was thinking.

Which was "What a fucking waste of money". I picked up the paper and
started to rip them out, meanwhile thinking that the paleface clerk
that had taken my money in Pascagoula was going to suffer three
different kids of hell when I laid my hands on him. If hell actually
existed, of course, which I really don't think it does, and you don't
either, right? You have been there, Gummy? That might account for your
lack of hair, for sure!

"Hey, hey, hey. No need to make a racket out of this." Boris told me and I stopped and
started to fold the papers with exaggerated care while looking at them. I
really didn't know what to do. I'd have to hire a band of rustlers to
get the iron dummy out of here. Disappointment probably crept to my
face, and Boris said

"These things happens. Wires go down, Circus Commission clerks gets
asleep, forgets to file the folder where he should. Tell you what: we
need strong and young hands like you around here, the Party knows we
do. So just stick around, I'll pay you by the day, and will check back
in a few days to see what happens. Does that sound fair to you?"

I just smiled and revisited my non-conformant thoughts on the paleface
clerk. This republic is the republic of all races and peoples of
America and the whole wide world, and palefaces, sorry, white people
have also been oppressed. All of you have, even the Duke. Isn't that
true, Duke? 

So that's how and why I entered the circus. Until my cover was blown
or I was off with my prize, whatever happened first. 

Circus hand. And foot
----------------------------

Do you think it would be easy to steal an elephant from a circus? They
are big, they are heavy, they can trample you or slug you a good one
with the trunk. Plus you need to know how to ride them or it will end
up somewhere else than the circus, but not where you want it. Well, a
mechanical man is pretty much the same, less the trunk. And the
shit. Man, do they shit...  The elephant bulls, Gummy, how could a
mechanical man shit? Bolts, you say? Ha, that's rich. 

Elephants shit their fucking weight plus a bonus every fucking day. This I know because that was how I started kicking sawdust. And
laying. And wiping. And producing. And fucking breathing and shitting
sawdust all the fucking day. That was all for the greater good, which
I could barely see, not to mention touch, during those first two
weeks. 

"Gaucho" was one the words I learned early and heard often during
those days, sometimes from closed lips, sometimes accompanied by a
sideways spit. That's how they call the people that is not born into
the circus, people sent from the circus commission specially, which
they call *red* gauchos. That's why I did not have other way out that
stick with them when sticking needed to be done. 

That was usually at lunchtime or when any food was served. As was done
in the army, we went to the mess tent, lined for food and went to a
table to eat. What? No, I haven't been in the army, in no army,
indeed. How do I know about that? People talk, you know. 

As a matter of fact, somebody told me that in the table where we
gauchos sat. There was Jay, who had actually fought in the patriotic
war and transferred to the circus, and now took care of animals, Bill and Vince, two roustabouts
that helped with anything that was needed, and Gina, who rode horses. 

And sometimes, Rufus the mechanical man man, the one that took care of
the mech, Rufus three-M himself, joined us. He couldn't have been born
into the circus, no mechanical men in the previous generation, no
way. So, despite have been for years in circus life he was still
considered a gaucho. He didn't do it himself, so he joined us
reluctantly and when there was pussy to be smelled. 

That didn't allow him to focus too much on the information I wanted
from him. Which was all for the better, People would have suspected if
I did. So I threw questions at him to see if they stuck, and they did
from time to time.

Did he score? Why are you interested? Hey, stop touching yourself,
Gummy you
old pervert! I'm out of here!

Gummy Eddie tells his story. Actually, no, Captain Corporal tells
Gummy Eddie's story
-----------------------------------------

Nobody understands Gummy Fucking Eddie, so I will tell his story for
him. Yes, I'll be telling you all my story in the army and why I'm a
Captain and a Corporal at the same time, but be patient and all of you
will be satisfied. Gummy, if you don't stop doing that right now I'm
not going to act your puppet now or never. Really.

So he was fighting for freedom in Cuba. He came back like this. OK,
don't throw a tantrum, I'll start again. 

It was 1905 or 1906, and Gummy was a jobless musician in Chicago. Then
everybody and his mother started talking about war this, war that,
Cuba, defending American interests, and all of a sudden I was in a
train all dressed in khaki with an old winchester and a bag in my
hands, bound for Florida. OK, not me, Gummy, but I'm translating him,
so I is gonna be Gummy from now on. You get it? Yes, you too,
Gummy, I'm so very happy you understand this.

In Tampa there was a big camp filled to the hilts with black people
like me. Most people going to Cuba seemed to be black, at least from
the sergeants down. Not that we saw anybody with heavier brass than
that. It was sergeant this, corporal that, sometimes a sergeant mayor,
and that was that. They barked their orders, clean this, drill that,
but mostly it was wait on our butts and roam around. Roaming stopped
fast enough, because as soon as we set step outside the camp whiteys
screamed abuse at us and we couldn't do much, no bars, no candy shops,
no nothing, everything was closed in front of our nose stubs. So we
stayed at the camp, one worry more for sergeants and corporals and
whatnots and one less for us.

But the problem with going to war is that you end up doing it. And on
a boat, to top it. We spent like a day puking our guts off so we saw
fishes in the sea literally get so fat they sunk to the bottom with
all the half-digested stuff we were throwing up and at them. It didn't
help that we were so packed in the boat that people just fell of the
brim from time to time, and some were so wasted they just stayed there
for the fishes to feast upon. Somebody surely missed them, but not us,
we were too busy keeping our guts together and worrying about what was
going to come next.

And that was hell, plain and simple. And I was lucky. The 17th Colored
Infantry didn't run into battle, we rather run from battle. After a
few skirmishes in, hell, in somewhere too hot for human beings, we
established a rearguard supply base in Guantánamo, One Ton of Ammo we
called, some smartass came with that because that was what they kept
telling us, we would be receiving one ton of this, one ton of that,
but the only thing we got was malaria and scurvy.

Yes, scurvy. The supply base didn't even have fresh supplies for
itself and whatever fresh we had was reserved for our sick brothers,
but at the end everybody was sick; we couldn't even move out of the
base because as soon as we did we heard the crack of the
sharpshooters. Many people did anyways, it was better to die quickly
than to do it slowly, painfully and stinking to high heaven.

I lost most of my teeth there due to scurvy. But I lost whatever I had
left when I was ferried back to Florida and was just left
there. "Discharged", I was told. That meant I was weaned off any GI
supply and left on my own, not a penny on me. I don't blame them,
anyways. They had quite enough on their own, being chased away by the
rebels, I mean the Glorious Revolutionary Army, hell, the government
snitch must one and for all stand up and fess up, I'm fed up with
having to put with all this revolutionary crap. We're between hobos,
right? We don't have to keep blabbing this way... no, that's not
Gummy, that's just me. Why do you want to know, Hatless?


There's a lot of vice in Miami
--------------------------------------

"We usually play to a full house here", Vincent told me while we were
on the road to post papers to announce the circus around town. Elegant
people came after us to check them out. "Look, we are scoring good
hits." Vince told me.

We were very lucky to be there. There were heavier and less amusing things you could do in the circus that very morning, in the stifling Miami heat. Besides, I was supposed to learn stuff. There was a method to posting paper, I was discovering. You
couldn't just paste them anywhere; barns, fences, some buildings,
corners, always at eye's height, those were the places to do it. As a
matter of fact, sometimes they were occupied by other posters
announcing past or present shows. They were promptly ditched, and this was accompanied by war stories of when two circus met in that place or that other and two posting parties met and mayhem ensued. I soon get bored of his talk and started to think whether this could be the day and place where I could finally escape alive and with a plus one called Manuel.   

We had a fair amount of ducat to invite beautiful girls to come to the
attractions and bring the local marks in tow. And man, they were
beautiful. So much cream colored flesh, and so much of them in plain
sight. We run out of ducat much before we run out of money and we
extracted so many promises... 

We had had to turn down a few, specially gringas. We didn't want them
there at the circus, but if they did show up, their pesos would be as good as the
next one, so we weren't gonna stop selling them tickets. Besides, they
had their special seats just for them, they had to be filled, right?

So, by the time Tracy came up to us, we weren't either ready for
conversation or in the mood for gifts. So much paper to post... Besides,
we had considered a couple of times to charley it.  

Who is Tracy? You're about to know her and we were about to do it, too. 

We didn't feel like talking to her because honkies, even honkie girls, were always walking around bumming things and complaining about this and that. Besides, she was not that beautiful to deserve one of the ducats we kept; she was nice, in that transparent way
the gringas had; her hair was flat and hay colored, and her hips and
boobs were way too small, although not disagreeably shaped. She didn't
smell good, a bit musty. Vince and me sent her on her way, but she
clung to us on our way back to the circus. Which pissed us off even more since now she would be witness to us ditching the paper; yes, that's what charley means, weren't you listening? Am I not talking in fucking English? OK, Duke, I'll keep it easy, only I get all fired up when I recall all that. 

"How long are you staying?" she  went, from a couple of steps behind us.

"It's right there on the paper, gringa. Can't you read?" She probably
couldn't. These palefaces were too ignorant and rebellious for their own good, they
just liked to spend their days shooting squirrels and drinking. And
fucking their sisters, I tell you. Many of them couldn't read just
because they hadn't enough in their heads to be able to join the lines
to form a letter. Yes, I know, Duke, it's an all-races republic. But including them does
not mean I have to *like* them, right? I could have liked this one,
though, if only she'd had a nicer and bigger rack. Nothing personal, Duke, you're my man. 

But she continued following us, asking us where we were from and what we did in the circus and so on and so forth until we were so close to the circus that we had either to charley the paper or take another path and start to paper it. We didn't feel like doing the second and we needed some independence.

"You want to earn a few pesos, girlie?" I asked her. If she came
around maybe we could check her for the revue. After seeing her naked,
we could either do her or hire her, or hire her and then do her. Not that I would have the chance to do either, but I could at least check her out thoroughly. And besides,
she didn't know squat, so I could play the part. If was not as if
Vince was going to tell her. At my question, she had opened her eyes and was
smiling broadly; we had her on the hook. She nodded a vehement "yes", opening her eyes and smiling broadly.

"So, do you have a name to go with those beautiful eyes?" I asked
her. Vince went along with me. 

"Tracy." She said while he blinked. Yay, we had her on the hook. Or
the other way round. 

"What do you say if you meet us at the circus in, say, two hours." She stared blankly, as if the concept of "hour" was something too difficult to grasp..."OK, to there after a good while, when you see people coming up to the circus, and you tell the girl at the ticket counter to send for us. We are Fulgencio and Vince. Can you remember that? OK, bye now." I waved her with my hand, just in case it was not clear enough. 

She nodded again, and turned back. When she disappeared around a corner we could finally charley the paper, and we might even manage to score tonight. 

Gringo up, gringo down
------------------------------

As we had expected, that evening the carnival was going full throttle, but I still could spot Tracy,
these gringas really don't know how to mix with the crowd. She was so
white and blond and she had put a white dress on top of that just so that
she could be made out even by night and with closed eyes. 

Trying all the time to look as if we owned the place, Vince and me got her to the ringmaster, with whom we had negotiated as a commission we got to see her naked
while she was checked for the nudist colony. That was the only act she
could make her do on short notice, because there's nothing much that needs to
be done, just be pretty and naked. Beautiful girls and some ugly with big boobs usually started  their career at the circus
that way before they learned something and graduated to the revues or
jig shows if they were whites, or even real circus acts if they were
good at it, and got and assignment from the government. 

But no government job was needed to lay stark naked and pout, which she
seemed to be good enough at. She wasn't too reluctant to undress when the ringmaster told her, and she only lingered at the unbuttoning at the interesting parts. She had no bra, as we had been able to make out under her white dress, but she wore panties that had seen so many washes that they were threadbare here and there. She eventually took them off also, standing there on her moccasins. She quickly fell into a pose. 
 
As I had already noticed with her clothes on, she did not have a great body, even for a
paleface. Too whitey, cute pair of boobs, those pink nipples could win
her a good pouch of pesos, and flat booty. But hey, she was white,
what could you expect. She had a bushy crotch that extended almost
up to her belly button. Nudist colony girls had it shaved, but there
was going to be no time today, the sideshows were about to begin. 

Vince, the ringmaster and me just left her there while we talked in whispers among
us as if we were examining a horse, appraising hers. She started to cover herself and
we knew it was time to hire or kick her off, because if we let it
linger for too long she could change her mind.

Yes, I knew all that by that time. You learn fast in the circus and
you learn a lot of trades, but the first thing you learn is people,
what they do and what you can do to them. That includes girls.
But I know much more now. I know that you can't trust no man and you can't trust women any more. By doing that, she forced us to action. And by forcing us to action, she commanded the situation. What's with girls, I don't know, they always make them do what they want and you end up thinking it was your idea. 

So of course she was hired for the day. Vince and me led her to the
carriage that was shared by the nudist colony girls that came with the
circus. Another day hire, or at least some girt I hadn't seen before, and, boy, had I seem them all in front of me and in my dreams, was also there and she was getting explained
how to pose and what to do and advised on how to avoid farting, conceal warts and
things like that. Just guessing that; we couldn't stay, of course, the mistress shooed us
away. I understand that, we men could be there the whole day and do no
work. Except maybe touching ourselves. Please, Gummy, you've already
done it today once, can't you please stop?

Somebody's daughter
------------------

That night I went to the girl show tent more than usual. I took
advantage of every errand to escape for a few seconds and go there to
see how Tracy was doing. Not that I could actually *get* in there, you
know. We roustabouts and circus mates weren't allowed in there, we
couldn't see the girls we shared a table at the mess room (not that it
was usual, but even so...) or a seat at the train completely naked and
in fetching poses. However, nobody could prevent us from ripping a
triangle off the tent and check it, from time to time. Before packing
they were checked and fixed, but new ones were open until after some
time the tent had so many patches at eye level (and a few at
midget-eye level) that it was on the brink of ripping the bottom part
off all by itself, so it had to be changed. That goes to say that
circus people are pretty much like the next guy, only a bit dustier
and a bit more skilled on separating marks from their
hardly-or-softly-as-if-anybody-cared earned money. 

I had to push Vince and some other circus guys who had heard about the
new flesh from time to time to check on her. She was doing great, of
course. The barker was barking the presence of new girls to the four
winds and gents were elbowing each other to be on the first row. Tracy
and the other new girl was there, in front of the rest, apparently
playing a table game, or resting, or doing silly dances which didn't
matter because, well, the important thing was the booby swing. The
professor talked about how important that was for health and how
everybody did that in Sweden or Siam or in old Greece or wherever, but nobody paid much
attention to the words. The important part was the swinging.  Yes,
boys, what swinging. Don't sigh, men, you've all been young and
smelled fresh pussy. 

I happened to be there, pushing aside one other gay, when the show was interrupted by a racket at the tent
gate. I couldn't see what was going on there, but I could see near the
scenario that several guys came into view shouting, and I first though they were
protesting for high prices or too much time waiting in line or
whatever. But they were yelling something about daughter and honor and
I think I heard the name Tracy and I could see they were wielding
clubs and baseball bats and even a machete. Tracy just stood there, and the men
came up to her, grabbing her arm and covering her with a blanket. The
other girls run to the back of the tent, and I was left there with the
professor, who seemed to be more elsewhere than there, and a few marks
who seemed to think this might be a part or the show or just liked to
be in the middle of things.  

When I arrived at the main tent door I pushed aside the people
flooding out from inside and came in, there was an standout
situation. One of the attackers had put a hand over the shoulders of
Tracy and another was holding another girl, one of our own. The barker
was laying on the floor, bleeding from the head. And I didn't know
very well what to do. First thought was run, but second though is that
the circus always protects their own. I then shouted

"Hey Rube!"

It's a clem!
--------------

There were on my count three, no, four, no, half a dozen guys in front
of the scene.  I couldn't handle them all by myself, no way. So I made
the call for other guys to join me and try to solve the situation.

Which didn't seem easily solvable without a broken limb. However, it
might be solvable without that limb breaking being mine, if I only got
a few more guys from the circus to help us.

Guy the gaffer was the first to arrive, as he always did. That was one
of the reason why he was allowed to boss everyone around even being
white, octoroon he said, but we knew he was white as white wool, that
he was. Hey, all races and all that, no problem, awright? Besides, he
was always there. He didn't even made a fist or expect other guys to
arrive, just pushed me aside and started to talk.

"What the fuck do you want with us?" He asked in the general direction
of the kidnappers. One of them, with overalls, a dirt-colored shirt,
cordless boots and and a baseball bat,
a middle-aged guy going on old age with a single tooth that we could
see, hissed and kind of said

"The honor of my daughter Tracy, who you're showing here naked an' all
for all niggers and spics to see..."

"Hey, hey, hey, mind your language, ol' mate. It's also there for you
honkies to see if you pay the price, matey!" He answered, raising his
hands, palms front and laughing. Not the right answer, apparently,
because all six or seven or them started to wield their weapons and
one of them picked up the professor from the floor and put the machete
by the side of his neck. 

"You'se a funny one, you. But you'se paying for this, and you'se
paying it dearly because the honor of a daughter has no price"

"You don't want anybody else but your own family banging her, do you,
matey?" Guy the gaffer said. The machete drew closer to the professor
neck, the baton closer to the other girl head, and one of the arms of
Tracy was released, just so the guy that had her, presumably his
brother, could shake the bate more freely with the other hand.

"That's what you niggers do. We white folk respect each other and God,
we do!" Guy could be only proud of being called a nigger, since he was
just getting out of his winter paleness. That might be the reason why
he seemed to change tack and stop insulting them.

"So you're all brothers and fathers, right? What if we call the Guard
and have all that checked out and we see who's right or wrong here?"
Asked Guy, making emphasis on the Guard. More people had arrived, but
the circus act was in full swing, so not many of them were
available. In fact, I think I could see a flicker of Rufus somewhere
to my left. 

"You call the Guard and before they arrive this girl has a new face
and that guy has no face. And any of us escapes alive, and everybody
will know that you called outside people to take care of your
business." Said the old guy. Ouch, that hurt. Guy the gaffer didn't
flinch. 

"Now we're talking, matey. How much is that honor thing worth to you?"

"No less than twenty and five thousand" The old toothless guy
answered, straight away. 

"Dollars? That's how much, thirty seven pesos?" The folks around Guy
laughed. In fact, it was closer to fifteen thousand, I
reckon. Eighteen thousand, you say, Duke? OK, around that. But it was
funny anyways. 

"You know better than that, nigger, you know what I mean, don't you," replied the old man.

"She's hardly worth half that amount. You seen her tits? Stupid question, that's what you have at home instead of radio, as civilized homes do." The old man took this in stride. It was money talking now, and that was a language they both understood very well. 



By this moment I was completely lost. Every word


* revise and write* 

We didn't start the fire
-----------------------------

But one of the midway concession shops was afire, and we run there. 

*write and revise*

Clown act
-------------

I saw the clown car go past us, pursuing the attackers in their
horses. Wigs and feet came out of its windows and they were honking
and laughing and shooting all at the same time. It didn't take long
for them to reach our attackers and in due time we could see light
arising from somewhere in the path, a few hundred yards ahead of us. 

I would have stopped right there but didn't, afraid of being uncovered
by the other circus hands. 

Not that I was under a cover, mind you. I just didn't want them to
know that my purpose in life was not to live in and by the circus,
just to get something out of it.

But I should have left everything right there and then, because I didn't like
what I saw down the road. It was not nice, you know. Not that they
didn't deserve it, but one thing is thinking that somebody deserves
what comes his way and another wanting him to be done in front of
you. 

It didn't take long for us to arrive there, but the whole time we
listened to laughs and explosions and shoots. And yells, some happy yells, some
not. The yellow light coming out of it and above it danced, as if
something was burning. And the smell. 

One of the horses the Klansmen were using came in our direction and it
very nearly made us fall from the horses; that along with the smoke
and smell frightened our horses and we could not start them back
again. So we tied them to some bush stalks and took from there by feet, half
running. 

Not that we could do much when we arrived at a small clearing at the
highway, from where the laughs and smells and smoke seemed to be
coming from. The four Klansmen, robes on fire, were lying down, one of
them still trying to stand up,
yelling, The clown posse was going around them, using their squirt
guns to douse them with something that kindled the fire, while they
were laughing. And  doing the routine.

"Oh my oh my oh my, my guests are on fire" said Clippo, the Auguste.

"They are just keeping warm, my boy.", answered Guido, the
Blackface. The other six were dancing around them, keeping a distance
and amusing themselves. Another one had gone to fetch the Klansmen's
horses.

"Oh my, they seem a tad too warm, ain't they." Said Clippo.

"Here, help them with a blanket." Answered Guido, giving him a 
handkerchief. Clippo made all a show of throwing the handkerchief on
what seemed now just a pile of ashes of a man.

This went on for a while, and the rest of us that had arrived later on
horseback couldn't do anything but look. Eventually Guido produced a
gun with a barrel as long as his leg and shot one of them, who still
was whimpering and moving, in the head.

All was quiet after that, except for the laughs of the clowns getting
back into their car.

"Let's go. Let the Guard take care of this mess".  We walked back to
our horses, not speaking at all. We arrived all tired and sooty back
at the circus and we went straight to our carriage; we could hear
laughs coming from the clown carriages for a while still.  

Rebuilding
-------------

Fortunately, nobody was badly damaged by the fire at the circus. And
you have to fight fire with fire, so no big deal here. But didn't mean
I had to breath the same air as the clowns, and I tried to keep as far
away from them as possible. 

As did, apparently, Rufus. Back then I did not know why, but he became
a bit twitchy every time a clown was getting close to us. That made
him almost a permanent fixture in the gaucho crew, even if there were
no revue girls around. 

He even  paid attention  sometimes when I talked to him, but he seemed
to have some difficulty staying focused, trying always to steal the
focus of the conversation to talk about other stuff.

The second greatest show on earth goes to New Orleans
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So we were going back to the United States of America. What was left
of them, 
anyways. They still seemed all too happy to shoot the odd border
patrol or even taking an useless pop at an airship, but was mostly
happy to get rid of second-rate citizens, or so it seemed. 

That was apparently not enough to restore the broken railway links
between the Republic and the US. Beyond Mobile, the railroad was blown
up to, at least, Red Bluff. So the easiest way to go from here to
there, from the real Land of the Free to the purported Land of the
Free, was to sail from Pensacola. 

So it was Noah's Ark all over again, as the Guy the circus manager said at
least one zillion times before, during and after boarding. Not that we
did not know already that all that Noah stuff was a big steaming pile
of elephant dung, but if you put lions and horses and bearded women
and whatnots inside a steamer they're gonna get mighty nervous, I tell
ya. So no way Noah would have made it for forty days. Unless he got him a
circus manager like we did. Friend of saying platitudes, but a good organizer
all the same.  

Yes, I would have preferred an airship. The circus comisario was on its
way to New Orleans already. But, pray tell, how the fuck do you expect
to put an elephant in an airship? You did it once? Really? Why didn't
you stick a couple of wings and a rocket up its butt and made it fly?
No way, man, absolutely no way you could put the thirty-odd carriages
in airships, you would have needed so many of them. Yes, you love
airships, Commodore, that's a fact.

It was my first chance to actually drive the mech. Aw, man, we are
calling it a hoborg, but just from a couple of nights ago! Just let me
call it the way I've always done. You want to hear the story? As I was
saying, you already know it has to be driven. On its own, he is barely
able to repeatedly bump into a wall or wander aimlessly like a chicken
whose head has just been bitten by a geek. Or a frog, yes,
Frog-Eatin'.  Grease was the one usually driving the mech, but he was
too busy disengaging carriages from the tractor, securing them on the
deck and trying at the same time to put the poor beasts at ease. The
space occupied by the mech was needed for something so I got to drive
it for the first time. 

No, it does not even come close to driving a horse and I ain't never
piloted a car. It's a metal box with a wheel and several levers and
knobs. I was told to never get farther than a dozen feet from from it,
this wheel for turning, this lever forward, this knob to make it
faster. Grease gave it to me, and I swear it turned its teakettle head
to look at me. Yes, it does that. It's not only levers and knobs and
whatnots. I still don't know what half the driving box does, but I do
know that the fucking mech has a mind of its own. No soul, Blackie, no
soul, man. No man's got a soul, nobody. It's humbug the American
capitalistas have been feeding you. So how come a fucking mechanical
contraption have a soul if not even you have it!  But, boy, does it
have a mind. A cat's mind, if you ask me.

So after checking me out he mostly did what it was told, turn right,
turn left, up the plank, to the prow. To tell you the truth, it kind
*wanted* to get to the very end of the prow; every time I veered away
to let it rest near the castle it kind of tugged to the right, as if
wanting to be there, looking at the sea. Ever seen the sea? Yes,
Count, you watched it for hours on end from your own boat. It's mighty
beautiful. No wonder even a mech would want to stand where he could watch it. Or maybe it
was just a bit cranky. Who knows. He could not have gone there,
anyways, because the space was taken by a bulk covered with a
tarp. Nothing related with the circus, it should have been there
before us, because the tarp had a different color, ours were green,
this one was tan. 

I didn't have the time to stay around to watch it any more because the
Guy the circus manager grabbed me again and had me doing Chinese, putting
things in cabins, covering the carriages with tarpaulins and hauling
supplies belowdecks. Which is a nice word that somebody shouted while
we were doing there and means in the basement of the ship. 

I got myself a cabin with Shorty and one of the windjammers. Which I
only discovered after I woke up to the sound of explosions
somewhere. Some mighty thunderstorm might be happening, but that was
unlikely since the boat did not seem to be swinging too
much. Something completely different might be going on, and I got
dressed and went up to the deck to check it out.

Attack on the high seas
------------------------------

When I arrived at the main deck, everything seemed to be quiet for a
few seconds. The sea was calm and deep blue, the sky only sported a
few wispy clouds, and the ship was rocked just a bit back and forth. I
took a breath and thought about going back to my cabin to properly
finish the dream I was dreaming when I heard a second explosion and
started to see what looked like the whole roustabout crew running to
both ends of the ship. Some of them were pointing up and above, a bit
to the left, "fore and port", somebody was yelling.

It was difficult to make out, but a few hundred of feet in that
direction was an airship. It was mostly painted in blue, sky blue but
its cabin had some struts coming out of it that were pointing directly
at us and apparently popping some rounds. 

"Some mark that has not been happy with our act, apparently." Raúl the
ringmaster was by my side, smiling with part of his mouth and smoking
his pipe. I hadn't heard his coming, as I never did. This guy was the
master of the ring and made himself heard and seen but his special
skill was to make that happen only when and if he wanted. 

"The airship was not on the table, then" I answered. "Or he would have
lost it. " That made his smile extensible to almost three quarters of
his mouth. And he snorted, too.

"They are probably pirates from Texas. The airship model is not
Spanish, They will fold as soon as they realize we can resist their
attack" He said, while returning his face to the standard smirk, and
he was on his way to the deck or wherever he was meant to be, leaving
me alone. 

The mystery of the tarp to the front of the ship was soon revealed
along with the long tube that was below it. It was quite obviously a
gun, and it didn't even need to be loaded; it had a big gunsight in
front of a seat which was quickly occupied by what I thought to be a
deck hand before. It didn't take long to have it shot; something came
out of it sprouting flames and unrolling a cable while the guy manning
the gunsight was moving a stick and turning knobs from time to time. 

"Looks like we are going to hunt us a big fat evil capitalista whale"
Raúl said, the crooked smile never leaving its face while the harpoon
wiggled towards the airship, which seemed to be getting farther and
farther up. Small geysers raised above the otherwise quiet surface of
the water, and we all seemed like the public of a lion taming act
without a jail, just looking on as if the air was protection enough to
what could happen. I knew it was not. And I knew I had to protect what
could be my property, so I run to the mech, which was just a few feet
behind the harpoon gun, unfastened it from the deck, retrieved the
driving box and started to move it.

It was stupid, of course. But nobody was there to tell me that at that
moment. No, it didn't sink, Gummy, you moron. Can't you see it is
right there. And please stop crying!

Rocking Manuel
---------------------

Give me a mud puddle and I can tell you how to pull a wagon out of
it. Give me a mare and I can get a foal out of his pussy. Give me
fourscore of bulls, and I'll tell you how to iron them in no time
flat.

But don't you give me anything over the water. Because it fucking
rocks and moves and can fucking sink to the bottom. So, get my advice:
grab anything that floats and don't move away from it. That's exactly
the opposite of what I did. I went for the most sinkable thing there
were, and I unfastened it and started to move it using the box. 

The damn guy wanted no part of it. I pushed the forward lever several
times, and it kind if shivered, but stayed theres. I heard the faint
sound of voices and the fizzling sound of something being dropped into
the see; sometimes a zing here and there, but nothing to worry
about. So when Three-M eventually moved I just had to worry about
keeping my two feet and its four wheels on deck, which was not the
easiest thing on earth. 

I moved to the left, which was starboard I think trying to keep the
bulk of the deck cabins between us and the airship, but we were moving
in fits and starts and I started to hear something clanking not so far
away from me, like metal drums. And I started to get worried, but not
enough to avoid the seasickness that was growing from my belly and
swelling up little by little.

It was not helping that I was walking backwards, keeping Three-M in
front of me and moving towards me. It didn't help that Three M was not
helping. It moved sideways, away from the see, and kept bumping with
things. I kept turning its head to look at the airship. And, I swear,
I didn't touch that knob, I didn't even know which one was the one for
turning the head. 

And he eventually saved my life. 

Biting the bait
------------------

I was dodging bullets or rather the sound of them and meanwhile
trying to move Three-M to a ramp that lead to the belly of the ship,
where at least there would be a few inches of steel between us and the
rest of the world. There was nobody else above board, since by now it
was either the guys manning the gun who might be reloading now for all
I knew or people who had no business being exposed to bullets, so It
was weird to see some strange shapes in front of me, towards the back
of the boat and right between the ramp that was my destination and
myself. 

Those shapes developed into three guys, dressed in tights; one of
them run to stern (abaft, I should say if I knew the first word about
nautical terms, which I don't), gun in hand, and the other two just started to
shoot. 

No, Captain, they hadn't descended from the airship, that was well and
away. We later found that they had used the airship as a bait so that
everybody got undercover and didn't see them approaching and boarding
the ship from a speed boat. They run and looked for valuables that
could be easily loaded and were on their way. 

Except that in this occasion  they had found me and Manuel. Either
they considered Manuel a strangely shaped buoy or they chose not to do
anything about him, but it was as if they just had seen me and started
to shoot their guns against me. I couldn't do anything from the
ground,  I didn't even dare to raise my head for fear it got a new
hole that afforded me a change of position to the shop of horrors of
the circus.

But the whole thing didn't take long. I heard them cursing and yelling
and the sound of falling to the water. I then raised my head and saw
Manuel was going past where the guys had stood and was slowly rolling
to a halt. 

I really didn't find out what had happened, other that there were
smears of blood in Manuel's claws. If he had just kept going, the two
pirates could have dodged him or pushed back. He did something to
throw them into the water, I just didn't know how or what. And he was
not gonna tell.

The third guy? He was given to the clown posse. I am not gonna talk
about it.

Closed for repairs
-----------------------

After New Orleans, something had become  loose in the head of Rufus the
mechanical man man. But I thought he was just moody until he flatly
told me that he was taking Manuel away from the circus. There was something funky going on there. Up until yesterday it was
working perfectly and all of a sudden the mech breaks down and has to
be taken somewhere for repairs.

"Where again is it going?" I asked Rufus. He looked to the right and
answered. 

"Well, he can only be fixed in the Estación Naval at Pensacola,
that's the only place where..." He was shuffling his feet and looking
as if he wanted to be somewhere else. 

"Can't we have a look? I've seen you mending it from time to time,
that way I can..." I said, hoping for a way to keep it close. 

"No way. This time it's broken real good. It's the photoelectric cell
that activates head movement so... Besides, the Torres Quevedo engine
has to be revised and reprogrammed... and while we are at it we'll
repaint, grease, change a thing here and there..." 

I couldn't allow that to happen. It couldn't go anywhere. 

"I can't do a thing, son. Seems legit, and I don't know a thing about
those things. You can go back to help the rest of the crew, don't
worry about that." Boris the manager told me when I grabbed hold of
him. But I wasn't worried about *that*, not precisely. That
was indeed the least of my worries. 

"But, gee, I don't know, It kind of didn't seem to have any kind of
problem, so..." 

"What do you mean?"

"Well, what I was saying is..." What was I saying? Send in the clowns
to maim and slay him? Couldn't do that, either. 

"I see. OK, let me check back and I'll see what I can do, OK?" Which
was possibly nothing. And I couldn't do a thing, either. I went back
to Rufus to try another angle. 

*write and revise*

This could be the end of my circus days, and the first day I was there
came back to me. That day I saw Manuel for the first time and I was
conned out of a good amount of pesos.

And then I knew how to grab hold of Manuel. So the circus day would
truly be over. 


Gaffe building for fun and profit
-----------------------------------------

I couldn't build it myself, of course. But if you've got the money and
the determination and the original model, nothing is impossible.

So the idea was not to recreate the mech, but to create something that
looked like the mech, at least from a distance and weighed like the
mech, so that when Rufus asked me to help him load it somewhere, I
would give him the gaffe instead of the real thing. The second part of
the con was, of course, to coax Rufus into having me help him take the
thing away.

Rufus himself helped me to get away with it. He wanted so much to make
everybody think Manuel was broken, that he loosed a screw or something
so that he, I mean it, Manuel, stopped working altogether. That made
easier to substitute it: I couldn't for the world make something that
looked and *acted* like the mech. 

Luckily, there were bits and parts of the mech in Rufus's workshop and
I took them to the circus blacksmith together with a bunch of pesos to
keep his mouth shut and instill due diligence in him, at least for a
while. Since everybody knew that sooner than later Manuel was going
away I told him we were building a replica for the menagerie, but
since Rufus was very jealous of his act we didn't want him to know
what we were doing, right? That was a few pesos more. And then a few
more when the diligence vanished after just a day.

*revise and write*

But it didn't take long to have something that if it was dark enough,
and from a distance, and if you really had seen Manuel just a couple
of times, could pass for the original. So there was no fucking way
Rufus could be mistaken. And I had spent two days and lots of pesos
doing this. 

That day, at dinner after the show, Rufus told me that somebody from
the naval station was coming the next day at dawn to pick them up. I
was relieved. Dawn was good. I was damn good. 




With the hobos around the fire
--------------

"I'm gonna get me one of those dummies, I'm gonna do it" The first
hobo announced, with just a hint of a threat in his voice, veiled by
the amount of moonshine he had already taken. José sat slumped a few
steps away from the fire, out of fuel or simply not working. Fulgencio
just spat at the fire, raising a small flame that made José look alive
for a brief moment. 

Fulgencio had found this group in a rail yard in Tallahassee when
descending from a train, trying to be unobtrusive. But there was no
way he could pull that out while 
being trailed by a two hundred and fifty pound walking cash register,
and he was immediately hailed by them and asked to join them by the
fire. Liquor was passed, bread and cheese shared, and histories
and local tips swapped. Then, more alcohol had flowed and everything
became a bit blurry as Fulgencio started to tell them his history, as
hobos do when gathered around the fire.
