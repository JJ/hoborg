Meet the mechanical man
----------------------------------

There he was, gleaming in places, rusty in others. Rolling and
whistling and frolicking to the general merriment of the public. 
And I'm using *he* liberally here, since I'm talking about a
mechanical man. A mechanical being. A mechanical... gimmick that looks
like a man.

I didn't really liked it, or even the idea of it, but I had no other
way out than be attached to it. On the other hand, the
public... filled with brothers, of my own race, of the other races
that had been oppressed since they arrived to this land or since the
paleface newcomers arrived. Even palefaces, because all races are one
and the same in the People's Republic, ain't that?

But I am not a paleface, because my name is Fulgencio
Rivera and  I was born and raised in California from a Guatemalan mother and
a Mexican father. That was twenty and three years ago. 

Now I'm here, at the Circus for the People, amusing myself while I bid
my time to get hold of the mechanical man, which is the main reason
I am here. Here being Freedomville, formerly called Jacksonville, as
in Andrew Jackson, a paleface and slaver long dead and now definitely
buried. 

And now being the tenth year after the revolution that produced the United
All Races People's Republic of Florida, or, if you prefer, la República Unida de Todas las Razas de Florida. 

But a free man has to earn a living, or a better living than the Republic is able to provide. That is why I am after Manuel,
the mechanical man. A real marvel of the People's Republic
ingenuity. Just look at him. All by himself, he has hushed everyone in
this dusty, hot, humid and forsaken place. How can I describe it? I
lack words, because there is nothing like it in the whole wide
world. I can try, even as I received only the barest of educations before
the evil capitalist system started to exploit my juvenile skills back there
in awful California of evil America. But I have no words to describe the
urgency with which I have to grab hold of it, since tonight is the
night it's going to be removed from here to places unknown and likely
more dangerous than here. 

But OK, OK, don't complain, I see that I am jumping over myself. Let me
tell you how it all started. 


Who wants a mechanical man?
-------------------------------------------

*revise* 

So this is what you hobos do, right? Sit around the fire in this rail
yard... Jungle? How come you call this a jungle? It's a railroad
switchyard! OK, jungle. And you tell tall tales, right? And you want to
hear mine? OK, Duke, I owe you. So here it goes. 

What do you mean,
Gummy? It's the plain truth. I will tell it to you exactly like it happened. Yes,
sir, I'm sure, what are you, a fuckin' people's court? 

Alright, then. The story of how I became in the possession of Manuel
the Man-Made Man starts in Mobile, which is only fitting, given the
circus obsession with phrases with words that all start the
same. Mobile, yes, time ago it was in Alabama, but now is  a
rough and tumble harbor town close to the border of the 
United All Races People's Republic of Florida. That's a pretty long
name for a place that starts at Pascagoula in the 
West and and goes no further
than Brunswick in the East, if only our people  have their way. Which they
will, I have no doubt as a loyal citizen of the Republic. Every
dawning day brings new brothers to our
new republic, brothers of all races, creeds and dispositions. 

OK, OK, on with the story. But you all reckon now I'm a loyal Republic
citizen, ain't I? So. It was early winter, but it was still sunny and mild. I was walking
in the docks, as I was wont to do. The air was clear and I could see ships
docking and leaving,  
ships from all our sister nations of the world, Spain, Cuba, Colombia,
Puerto Rico, but also from not-so-friendly places 
who decided the buck needn't stop here and had resumed trade as soon as the
smoke from the Freedom War settled down and become the smoke of the
smokestacks built during the Planazo, formerly unfriendly places like  
the imperialist United Kingdom, the Austrohungarian Empire, those bohunks... The
air swarmed also with the airships about to dock or leave from the
airship port, the Spanish clover-fronted ones, the elegant Cubans,
even the odd bulky and slumbering American, you could just spend the
whole day looking at them, slowly realizing they were no longer in the
place you had first spotted them, in the middle of a cloud, or watching them
appearing nose first from the middle of another. Yes, Gummy, they do look like that sometimes. If
that's what you're thinking about. Which you, no doubt, are.

I was there, looking up and down while strolling alongside the docks, minding my own business,
which was precisely what I was looking for at that early moment of the
day. I needed a hire, was looking to be hired for a fix for somebody who needed a quick mind and a strong pair
of arms, and I kept dodging the sun and keeping myself in the shade,
because the sun made  my clothes too warm for comfort. What was it?
Big Winter? Winter's younger brother? Can't
tell, Rvfo Cuse or Rakko,  less so now that all months have changed their names to
something that does not have gods or umpirators or unpopular
names. But it's always little this or big that or whatever berry,
so... It's Otowosk-rakko now, right? Otowoskuce, you say, Gummy? Can't
be Ehole, no way, not so cold... Well, you see, people no longer know the month they are
in. Not that most of us had ever cared, anyways. And not that I have a
grudge with that, either. It's all for the greater good of the
Republic, ain't it? Keeping capitalists names out of the Republic and
putting the names the great spirit of the people gave them. Whatever.

So, sunny it was and I was walking in the shade. OK? Don't say I keep
repeating myself, you don't stop whining and yawning! Here comes what
happened: these two dandy types came up to me from the sea
shore, maybe from a ship, maybe from one of the airships that had landed a bit
farther up the docks, dressed to the
nines and sweating as if they were going to melt right there and then. Sticking out as a
sore thumb, if you ask me, no way to walk in this place crying "Mug
me". Adding insult to injury they were also  yelling "I'm a capitalist
pig". But I was minding my own business, which was for the time being not related to those
guys, but could be. 

No, they had a pretty normal face and hair; they were nondescript
besides what I have already said. Although they 
 had probably not been mugged yet because one of the dandies had his
demeanor bolted on, instead of having been born into it. Strong but
nondescript too. Or nondescript for a those-fists-mean-business
meaning of the word. 

I kind of put myself in a position where, if bad came to worse, I could have many
options. Walked away from the wall, squinted to see what they were up
to, put my hands in a fist and out of the pockets. 
Was not afraid, though, although they also seemed to avoid the glare and had
their caps set just so you could not really see their face. So
that you could not describe it later. That is why they were
nondescript. Hey, said that already. You weren't listening?

As they approached, the non-strong non-descript guy seemed to be the one that was going to
do the talking, which he started to do as soon as he possibly could 
without shouting. After touching their caps managing not to reveal
even a tiny bit more of their faces and exchanging pleasantries, which was the right
thing to do for well-educated gentlemen that we all were, they offered
me a cigar which I rejected because I don't smoke, as you might have
already noticed, and went down to business, not-strong in front of me
and fists-mean-business by my side and slightly behind me. He really
meant business that way too. Still not afraid, because I still had
options. One of them, by the way, was to listen to them and eventually
do business. 

No, Gummy, I didn't hit them. Why should I? I was down on my luck. If
two nondescript persons make an offer, or one does while the other has
an slightly threatening posture, you listen to them. One's got to earn
a living, and I was just thinking about doing the same the Republic
did with those imperialistic airships. No harm done if no harm is
done, right? Well, you know now that some harm would be *eventually*
done. But I didn't know back then. 

Besides, their words and general demeanor told me that a good living it might be, too. Ten thousand pesos on the spot,
ten thousand more when I got them something, which they really, really
wanted for no particular reason. They were collectors. They had a hardware
store. They liked shiny, rolling things. Those were a few of the
reasons they offered for  wanting the mech, which they called Manuel
the Mechanical Man. Which they told me was, metaphorically speaking, 
I know, Duke, you like when I speak metaphorically, kicking dust in a
circus.  

Before that sunny day in the Mobile docks, I had never heard of the
thing.  What was my business before that day, do you want to know? Dock hand, I
just told you, Dale. Damn, do you want to hear the story or not? 
You had heard about that Manuel that is now stashed in the moored
wagon before I showed up here with it? Well, I hadn't, I was not so 
well informed and educated as you all apparently are in this
jungle. 

Which is why the speaking non-descript man described it for me,
just in case I got it wrong and got them a kicking watering can or the
tin man from the Wizard of Oz.  

"This gimmick Manuel you've got to get us  is like a a rolling
teakettle with ears", he told me.  

A rolling teakettle with ears
------------------------------------

*revise and write*

Think about the Tin Woodsman. Did you all read it? You didn't? Too old
for it, Duke? Nobody did? Doesn't matter, because this Manuel was
almost, but not quite, completely different from that. And not made of
tin, either. 

Think now about a teakettle. You got it? That's it, thicker on the bottom
and not so much on top. Yes, Count, we all know you served tea to
royalty in your castle in Central Europe. Alright, south by southwest
Europe. Whatever. You picture that, right? That would be a milk pail
for you, Gummy. Please stop smiling or I'll never ever say your name
aloud again. You all got the milk pail? Well, now put it on top of the
teakettle. A small one. Two milk pails for you, Gummy. Lost you? Aw,
what the hell, just go to sleep again. 

Lost you all? Big, roundish, thick-on-the-bottom, metallic, upside-down
bucket with another on top, body and head. Which goes to account for
the name mechanical man, but when I first saw him that what I though
about. It was even steaming a little bit, because he's not actually
mechanical, you see, it's also fuel-powered ad some electrickal cables
to spark it to motion whenever it's needed. Or something like that. I
didn't built it, I just carry it from one place to another. 

And, you see, it ain't have any legs. I don't know why, man, but those
four wheels it has on the bottom just save me a lot of work. Yes, it
did have some sort of midget legs at the beginning, but they made him,
er, it, a piece of larry on stilted legs so they were ripped of and
substituted by this bogie rigged from, gee, I really don't know. A toy
train? A streetcar? But the wheels, they had real tires on them, lest
it could move only on rails. Come to think of it, I'll have to patch
them, they seem the worse for wear now... 

Of course the legs didn't go to waste! They were used for a sideshow
in the ten-in-one called Robbie Lee, the Half-Mechanical Wonder of the
New Century!

So what we have here is a teakettle with ears on wheels. A mechanical
hobo. A hobo mechanical organism? Count, I like that. Cut it down to
hoborg and you've got it! Pass the bottle, man, don't hog it all for yourself!

Arms? Gee, I forgot that. Of course it did have arms! Just two of
them, yes. I always wondered why. Come to build a thing with arms, you
could make it with three or four or what have you. But no, it had to be two and
they looked like those in mannequins, with a joint in the elbow and
another at the shoulder and a grip at the end. No hands, just a
grip. I didn't try to wrestle with him, no way. It was four hundred
pounds of iron and copper. The grips were made with copper, and they
could be so delicate as to grasp a pigeon egg without breaking
it. Great machine, I tell you. 

Yes, let's make it dance for a while, let me just get my driving box. 
Eyes. Did I say anything about the whole fucking *face*? No proper
face to speak of, really, but as soon as there's something on top of
the body, not that it's a proper body either, but you get my
drift... so if that upside down bucket is a *head*, the grilled gap on the bottom, that
would be a mouth, right? On top of that a strut could be the nose, and
two holes covered with glass the eyes. Some dummy painted two lines on
top of that that could go for eyebrows, and then there were two holes on the side
of the head with two half-moons behind them. The head could move left and
right, that's it, couldn't nod at all. If it wanted to look down it
had to bend all over. And when it moved it made a screeching noise,
like a door closing. A 
teensy door closing. Well, a teensy but heavy door closing. 

When it walked, or rather rolled, there was smoke coming out of its
neck. Some dummy put it initially in the ass, but it made the eyes of
whoever was driving it sting, so somebody else rigged it to have the
exhaust as hight as possible. Not in the head, it wouldn't look
healthy, people would be all "Your dummy is *burning*!".

Anyway, the noise. It could honk, did I tell ya? Yes, he can do stuff
all of its own when he wants. When there's something in front, I don't
know how the hell it does that, but he notices and honks the same way
that he avoids to crash into people by just stopping. How do I know
how it does that? Am I a fucking mechanician? So, all things
considered,  it sounded like a car coming at you if you didn't see it
coming. A honking, screeching, clanking little car.

And now, for all of you, a honking, screeching, clanking and dancing
mech. 

Well, enough with the dancing. We're going to spend the fuel, and I
don't have that much to go. Yes, it runs on petrol, like any other
machine. And electricity. And spit.

Settling accounts with the clowns
-------------------------------------------------

"Rufus, be short and to the point. We all know what's going on, so
tell us only what we don't know." Said Boris. Rufus was visibly
shivering. Cracker and his sidekick Clippo had came down and where now
at the other side of the center of the circus ring of where Rufus
was. Boris, ever the master of ceremonies, was in a lectern placed
close to one of the ring gates. Cracker was in his full clown suit and
had even retouched his black makeup to look as if he was going to do
his act. And Clippo seemed to be there for no reason other than to
laugh at every movement. 

He opened his mouth to talk several times until he managed
to produce a sound.

"Manuel the mech was assigned to me by the People's High Commission of Science
and Technology. I was specially trained to command it and make repairs
that don't require special machinery. I am the only person qualified
to do that in this circus"

"But you are, aren't you, Rufus? You're the greatest mechanical man
man there! Let's all give an applause to this most excellent of
mechanical men men!" Said Cracker, and Clippo started to walk around
the ring clapping his hands over his head. All the people followed,
clapping and hooting. It actually took a while until it died down.

"So all I'm asking is to let the most qualified person... " Continued
Rufus.

"Which you no doubt are, Rufus. Let's give him another round of
applause for qualification!" Same thing again, although it took less
for it to die down. 

"The mech is about praising and showing the people's technology. It
can't be used for..." Rufus tried to say.

"But it can't, can't it?" He moved away from his position and started
to make a ceremonious introduction, "And now... with all of
you... Manny The Mechanical Clown!" And into the ring came Manuel, all
painted in checkered maroon, blue and white colors, the colors of the
republic, waving flags with both hands. After him came the full troupe
of clowns, who tried to ride him, climbing on him and falling down,
legs up, to the general merriment of the circus people. The band
started to play and highlighted falls with bass drum strokes.

"Can't... can't do that!" Said Rufus, and started to try and follow
Manuel, who had now changed to pursuit mode and was trying to catch
the clowns who were all running in a row in front of it. A game of cat
and mouse followed, whenever Rufus was approaching Manuel it slowed
down and when it was about to grab it it sped back again, to the sound
of the band and the roll of the drums. Cracker started to go around
the ring making people clap their hands, and it was all laughs and
cheers and the discussion was pretty much over.

Cracker had the last word, as he always did. After a while like that,
Manuel turned around and caught Rufus off-guard, surrounding him with
its arms and raising it a few inches over the floor. Rufus' face
contorted, trying to escape. Manuel brought him to confront Ted.

"Who's controlling who, now, Rufus? Who's more qualified? Who should
be in charge? We'll let you have it alright, but only after and when
we want. Is that right, Boris? He said, addressing the circus manager.

"I couldn't care less, and I had a great time here, so whoever attends
will too." Manuel dropped Rufus, who fell to the floor. "All out and
over, all out, all over." That was the sign that everything had
finished. People shuffled out of the ring, the clowns circled it with
Manuel in tow, and Rufus was just there, a rag of a man. I came down
to him and helped him to stand up, brushing his clothes. His eyes were
all rage, but his mouth was clapped shut. 


Closed for repairs
-----------------------

*write and revise* 

But I thought he was just moody until he flatly
told me that he was taking Manuel away from the circus. 

There was something funky going on there. Funkier that whatever I was
up to, at least. Yes, I am not a people's guard, but funky is funky,
OK? 
Up until yesterday it was
working perfectly and all of a sudden the mech breaks down and has to
be taken somewhere for repairs. It had been dented and had chipped in
some places, but it wasn't that bad. Well, it was also a bit rustier
than before it had sailed; the hot funk of New Orleans and the sea are
no good for him, I tell you. But nothing a bit of paint and a hammer
here and there could not mend. 

"Where again is it going?" I asked Rufus. He looked to his right and
answered. 

"Well, he can only be fixed in the Estación Naval at Pensacola,
that's the only place where..." He was shuffling his feet and looking
as if he wanted to be somewhere else. 

"Can't we have a look? I've seen you mending it from time to time,
that way I can..." I said, hoping for a way to keep it close. 

"No way. This time it's broken real good. It's the photoelectric cell
that activates head movement so... Besides, the Torres Quevedo engine
has to be revised and reprogrammed... and while we are at it we'll
repaint, grease, change a thing here and there..." Maybe he didn't say
that, but it sounded like that. 

I couldn't allow that to happen. It couldn't go anywhere. And I looked
for a way of keeping him in so that I could get it out. 

"I can't do a damn thing, son. He's given me a wad of papers that seem
legit as far as I can tell a. Besides, neither me nor anybody else in
the circus know squat about
those things, so it's got to be taken elsewhere to have it fixed real
good. So enough with that, if you're our of that job until he returns you can go back to help the rest of the crew, don't
worry about that." Boris the manager told me when I grabbed hold of
him. But I wasn't worried about *that*, not precisely. That
was indeed the least of my worries. 

"But, gee, I don't know, It kind of didn't seem to have any kind of
problem, so..." 

"What do you mean?"

"Well, what I was saying is..." What  I was  saying was what? That I
intended to take it away myself? That if I didn't manage that, just
out of spite I
was going to snitch on Rufus to the clowns  who were going
to maim and slay him? Couldn't do that, either. 

"I see. OK, let me check back with the ministry and I'll see what I
can do, whether I can get some other act or something, OK?" 
Out of a robot and in a dancing poodles act, I was seeing myself doing
that. Yes, they are cute, Captain. Get yourself a dozen and make them
dance a cutesy polka. 

So I was going to get nothing out of that. So I went back
to Rufus to try another angle. He was tweaking at things inside
Manuel, who was slightly bent and with a hatch in the back wide
open. He closed it tight when he heard me opening the door to his
workshop. 

"You'll need help for the transport." I told him.

*write and revise*

This could be the end of my circus days, which I expected to arrive
anyways sooner or later, but not like this. But the first day I was
there 
came back to me. That day I saw Manuel for the first time and I was
conned out of a good amount of pesos.

And then I knew how to grab hold of Manuel. So the circus day would
truly be over, but it would be over my way and a good way, too. 


Gaffe building for fun and profit
-----------------------------------------

I couldn't build it myself, of course. But if you've got the money and
the determination and the original model, nothing is impossible.

So the idea was not to recreate the mech, but to create something that
looked like the mech, at least from a distance and weighed like the
mech, so that when Rufus asked me to help him load it somewhere, I
would give him the gaffe instead of the real thing. The second part of
the con was, of course, to coax Rufus into having me help him take the
thing away.

Rufus himself helped me to get away with it. He wanted so much to make
everybody think Manuel was broken, that he loosed a screw or something
so that he, I mean it, Manuel, stopped working altogether. That made
easier to substitute it: I couldn't for the world make something that
looked and *acted* like the mech. 

Luckily, there were bits and parts of the mech in Rufus's workshop and
I took them to the circus blacksmith together with a wad of pesos to
keep his mouth shut and instill due diligence in him, at least for a
while. Since everybody knew that sooner than  Manuel was going
away soon I told him we were building a replica for the menagerie, but
since Rufus was very jealous of his act we didn't want him to know
what we were doing, right? That was a few pesos more. And then a few
more when the diligence vanished after just a day.

And the questions increased in the same proportion. Who was going to
be in charge of the gaffe? Did I want just one or several to sell?
Could the thing be traced back to him? I had to answer yes to that
one, there were nobody else in the circus with the tools to do it, and
that answer had to have more pesos attached. 

But he eventually could not get himself to finish it. A day in which
his sweat could not entirely be justified by the heat in his workshop,
he gave me a burlap bag stuffed with clanking things and sent me on my
way. 

I was then at a loss. Rufus could leave any time now. And then I
remembered Tracy.

I needed Tracy to keep him busy and focused on something other than
the gaffe. I talked to her, she owed me, and, honkie and all, she
paid her dues so she not-so-reluctanctly agreed to keep Rufus
distracted when needed. Which might be any time now.

I took everything to a city car mechanic and gave him the sack and the
money. And a dozen of ducat to watch the show so that he could see the mech in
action and have an idea of how to rig what I gave him together to make
it look like that. And to have him keep his mouth shut, no question
asked, no sideways looks when I was bullshitting him about what I
wanted the stuff for. 

I didn't have much confidence in the guy, but actually it didn't take
him long to have something that if seen in the dark, 
and from a distance, and if you really had seen Manuel just a couple
of times, could pass for the original. So there was no fucking way
Rufus could be mistaken. And I had spent two days and lots of pesos
doing this. 

That day, at dinner after the show, Rufus told me that somebody from
the naval station was coming the next day at dawn to pick them up. I
had actually seen him talking to a couple of look-alike guys with
moustaches that look exactly like what you saw in your mind when you
thought about a bohunk, and nothing like what you see when you think
"sailor". Yes, they had that. No, not that. Well, a bit. But, you
know, we are the rainbow republic, bohunks and whiteys and everything
it between, so what the hell.

Besides, I
was relieved. Dawn was good. I was damn good.  Yes, a damn good
dawn. Why are you laughing?


Dawning on her
--------------------
*revise and write*

"I just wanted to have a nice and wet farewell from you." Tracy told
Rufus with a voice and hip motion that would have had the Pope of Rome
convert to a life of sins right there and then. Tracy  was good at this, she had been born for
this. Honkies were not good for much else, Gummy, are you smiling?
Can't tell, without all the teeth.

Anyway, the face of Rufus and his dropped jaw told me that he'd fell bait, hook and switch
for it.  But, at the same time, he was stealing looks back to the carriage
where Manuel was stored, it was just a couple of hours away to dawn
and the other honkies were coming to get him away. Come to think of
it again, it was queer how many honkies were there in the Navy, two of them. And they
had worn nothing that looked like an uniform when I had seen them before.

But I didn't care. "Rufus, should I help you with Manuel? I can drive
it to the truck, while you, er, do other stuff" He didn't even look back to me since his mouth was anchored to
Tracy's by a long line of tongue and concomitant fluids. That was what I needed to make the
first switch. 

That part was easy. Most people were sleeping or doing nasty things in
their beds, so they were beyond care when I drove Manuel to the tigers cage
and hid it there. This might seem more difficult than it actually
was. Tigers sleep very soundly, not having a care in the world, and
the only thing you have to care about when entering their cage is not
to step on them. This they don't like. *revise and write*
 I put the gaffe in place of Manuel and covered it
with a canvas.

The difficult part was going to be to drive the gaffe into the truck bed. But I
still had Tracy. 

Gripping gaffes
--------------------

"Not only I have to hump that drooling geek, but I also have to help
you to haul stuff." Said Tracy.

"You owe me." I told her. She opened her mouth to say something. Then
she closed. She looked lovely when she did that. Then she opened it
again and she stopped looking anything like lovely.

"How much do you reckon I still owe you?" she said, crooking her mouth
and joining her eyebrows until they formed a thick bush in the middle
or her forehead. In fact, she had a single eyebrow, so frowning made
her look as if she had a moustache. Which, come to think of it, she
also had. Man, do cracker women have hair in all the wrong places... 

So well, she helped me to carry the gaffe to the truck bed; a truck
that didn't look either like a Navy truck, but who knows actually what
Navy trucks look like. I had seen the sailors coming off it, maybe to
have a quickie with the girls as the sailors are wont to, yes, Gummy,
as any man does, well, whatever, they were not there and we managed
with a bit of work and a few ropes to load it up the truck and stow it
there. 

We were finishing when the light was starting to shine in the horizon
and the circus was, lazily, coming out of their wagons and rummaging
through the grounds to start their daily chores. I could hear the
elephants baying and the horses neigh but yawns were even louder. I
could also smell animal smells and tobacco smells and could hear and
smell at the same time the sound of fat on frying pans. A new day
kicking sand in the circus, a day less for me. 

Tracy vanished with a yawn and left me loitering around the truck. The
sailors came back after a while, buttoning their pants, laughing and
giving each other palm strikes in the back. Happy and sleepy, just the
way I wanted them, and in pretty much the same shape Rufus showed up a
while after that.

But the sun was already over the horizon and that's a situation in
which gaffes shine just the way they are: humbugs, hoaxes and plainly
not the thing they're supposed to be. So I had to make them not look
under the burlap. 

Easier said than done. No, Captain, I couldn't hit them, they were
three and I was one. No, Duke, I couldn't bribe them, my pesos had run
out and I only had the money I had managed to oach when handing the
popper.  

In fact, the very moment Rufus looked at the covered lump in the truck
the only thing I could think about was to start and cry.

*revise and write* 

Crocodile tears
-------------------

I cried like I've seen the clowns doing in their act. Close your eyes
just so, open your mouth, and wail a trembling a for as long as you
don't care to breath. That might be a long time, indeed, just enough
to be noticed by Rufus, who came up to me and put an awkward hand in
my back.

"What's up, man?" Glancing sideways I could see the bohunks were
growing restive and showing it by standing by the truck and casting
their own glances back and forth.

"You're leaving... and Manuel... and the circus..." I repeated this
over and over between sobs that were also interrupted by some
non-words I put in for good measure.

"Well, yes, but I, you know, I will... well, I mean it's got to be
fixed, so it shouldn't take long... " He paused here and I took the
cue to continue sobbing all over again; damn tears, they resisted to
get out. "Well, it could take, but when, er, we come back I'll let
you, er, drive" As if.  Meanwhile, the not-quite-revolutionary sailors
had started the truck and were stepping on the pedal making noises for
good measure. I stopped crying and hugged the guy.

"Gee, thanks, Rufus. All I need now." I pushed him lightly on the
shoulder. "Goodbye." 

He didn't even look at the lump the truck was carrying. I had some
time until they noticed. At least, until they stopped to take a pee,
which might take long, as long as they've had all their piping well
cleaned before leaving.  

I went back to the cage, where I was received by a few hungry tigers
doing the rounds and roaring and moaning. I was going to need some
good time to get the real Manuel back from there. 

With the hobos around the fire
--------------

"I'm gonna get me one of those dummies, I'm gonna do it" The first
hobo announced, with just a hint of a threat in his voice, veiled by
the amount of moonshine he had already taken. José sat slumped a few
steps away from the fire, out of fuel or simply not working. Fulgencio
just spat at the fire, raising a small flame that made José look alive
for a brief moment. 

Fulgencio had found this group in a rail yard in Tallahassee when
descending from a train, trying to be unobtrusive. But there was no
way he could pull that out while 
being trailed by a two hundred and fifty pound walking cash register,
and he was immediately hailed by them and asked to join them by the
fire. Liquor was passed, bread and cheese shared, and histories
and local tips swapped. Then, more alcohol had flowed and everything
became a bit blurry as Fulgencio started to tell them his history, as
hobos do when gathered around the fire.

This book started one fine day of May, but would not have been
possible without the help of many people around me, most of them
unknown. So I would like to dedicate it to the people that [answered
my question on symbols on the History
StackExchange](http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/8894/looking-for-a-symbol-for-southern-usa-communism) and then [another
question on circus layout](http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/8942/where-can-i-find-american-circus-or-carnival-grounds-plans/8972?noredirect=1). Marian,
the librarian of the Clarke College was also incredibly helpful.
