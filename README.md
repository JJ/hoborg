Plot outline
---------------

After the United States of America is defeated by a technologically superior Cuba and
Spain, Florida becomes an independent multiracial socialist state
which is inmediately at war with the (now diminished) America. 

A North-American Pinkerton agent is sent there to recover a
*mechanical man* that has been seen in a circus doing gigs from
Pensacola to St. Petersburg, entertaining the masses. 

He succeeds, or not, but taking the loot back to Washington might not be so easy. He becomes a
railway hobo, accompanied with a hobo cyborg - the *hoborg* of the title.

How you can help
-----------------------

After the paragraphs above, you might have already realized English is not my
first language. Sending me corrections is not the only way you can help

* You can just
  [follow @hoborg_novel on Twitter](http://twitter.com/hoborg_novel)
  or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManuelTheMagnificent) and interact with it.
* Get a [GitHub account](http://github.com).
* Watch, star or fork this repo. You don't need to do anything else.
   for the time being, but it will help me achieve some visibility.
* You can interact with the text and the rest directly from the web:
  you can comment on text and changes in it (called *commits*).
* You can also request changes on the text using [*issues*](https://github.com/JJ/hoborg/issues). If you find
  an error of any kind, just raise an issue and I'll fix it (or try
  to).
* Create your own version: once forked, you can use git (check out
  this manual http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Git_for_dummies ) to
  branch and evolve the story in whichever way you want.
* You can keep that copy (hey, it's free as in free speech) or, if you think
  it's a worthwhile addition to Hoborg, do a Pull Request.
* [Check out the TODO list](TODO.md) in case you find something that
  you could do yourself. 

Full disclosure
------------------

The novel is roughly completed (that is, it's got an ending, it will
actually never be finished since it might evolve in time) and is
published on Amazon.com and the on rest of the Amazon shops. Since all
your contributions will be here, in the repo, they are obviously
acknowledged, but I'll acknowledge it also in the prologue itself and,
if I earn enough to be able to physically print it and mail it, will
mail you a copy. That's quite unlikely to happen, however, so I'll
make a promise I can keep: to follow you in Twitter, so accompany your 
pull request with your Twitter account so I can fulfill my promise. 

Start reading and participating
---------------------------------------

Just go to [the novel](text/text.md). You can also
[read about the characters](text/characters.md), although doing so
might result in spoilerage, or about the
[geography of the Republic of Florida](text/geography.md). 

Thanks
------

Many thanks to those that have provided
[fixes and suggestions](https://github.com/JJ/hoborg/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)
to the text: [`yarikoptic`](https://github.com/yarikoptic) and [`quentessential`](http://github.com/quentessential).

How this can help you write your own novel
-----------------------

Read the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) to get your very own novel going in Github. They are long-ish, but may be worth the while. 

Navigating the repository
---------------------------------

You already know the [text](text/text.md) directory, which contains
the novel text itself as well as scraps we might need for
later. [resources](resources/README.md) contains HTML templates,
images and other non-text stuff. [apps](apps/README.md) includes
conversion scripts and other mainly Perl scripts I use for managing
this. [Text-Hoborg](Text-Hoborg/README) contains a Perl module that is
used for testing and continuous integration and might eventually
contain the novel itself and be released that way. 

Get in touch
---------------

If you have some issue related to the novel, [use the GitHub
issues](https://github.com/JJ/hoborg/issues), any other business, just
